# Mathematical Formulation of Pi-Encoding on a Sphere with Internal Torus Mapping

## 1. Surface Encoding

The surface of the sphere is parameterized using spherical coordinates:
- Radius: $R = 1$
- Polar angle: $\theta \in [0, \pi]$
- Azimuthal angle: $\phi \in [0, 2\pi]$

The Cartesian coordinates are given by:
$x = R \sin\theta \cos\phi$
$y = R \sin\theta \sin\phi$
$z = R \cos\theta$

Each point $(\theta_i, \phi_j)$ on the surface is assigned a color value based on the corresponding digit of $\pi$ and its prime properties:

$C(\theta_i, \phi_j) = \begin{cases}
10 + \pi[k] & \text{if } \pi[k] \text{ is prime} \\
n_f + \pi[k]/10 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$

where $\pi[k]$ is the $k$-th digit of $\pi$, and $n_f$ is the number of prime factors (with multiplicity) of $\pi[k]$.

## 2. Internal Torus Mapping

The internal structure is created by mapping a torus to points inside the sphere. The torus is parameterized by:
- Major radius: $R_{torus} = 0.6$
- Minor radius: $r_{torus} = 0.3$
- Parameters: $u, v \in [0, 2\pi]$

The torus coordinates are:
$x_{torus} = (R_{torus} + r_{torus}\cos v)\cos u$
$y_{torus} = (R_{torus} + r_{torus}\cos v)\sin u$
$z_{torus} = r_{torus}\sin v$

These are then mapped to points inside the sphere using a scaling factor:
$\text{scale} = \frac{R_{sphere}}{\sqrt{x_{torus}^2 + y_{torus}^2 + z_{torus}^2}} \cdot \text{random}(0.1, 0.9)$

The final internal coordinates are:
$x_{internal} = x_{torus} \cdot \text{scale}$
$y_{internal} = y_{torus} \cdot \text{scale}$
$z_{internal} = z_{torus} \cdot \text{scale}$

Each internal point is also assigned a color value based on the corresponding digit of $\pi$ and its prime properties, using the same formula as for the surface points.

## 3. Connection to G⁴=1 Framework

In the G⁴=1 framework, the gravitational coupling G varies with energy E according to:

$G(E) = G_0 \left(\frac{E}{E_{Planck}}\right)^{-\alpha}$

where $\alpha$ is chosen to satisfy G⁴=1.

The mapping of $\pi$ digits to the sphere can be interpreted as encoding information at different energy scales:
- Surface points represent higher energy scales (closer to the Planck scale)
- Internal points represent lower energy scales

The prime factorization properties of the $\pi$ digits determine the "resonance" between these different scales, creating a harmonic structure that reflects the running of G with energy in the G⁴=1 framework.

## 4. Geometric Interpretation

The resulting structure can be interpreted as a geometric manifestation of the connection between:
- The transcendental nature of $\pi$
- The fundamental properties of prime numbers
- The scale-dependent nature of gravity in the G⁴=1 framework

The sphere with its internal torus mapping represents a unified geometric object where these mathematical and physical concepts converge, revealing deep connections between number theory, geometry, and quantum gravity.
