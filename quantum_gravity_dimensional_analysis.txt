# Dimensional Analysis in Quantum Gravity

The study of quantum gravity requires a careful analysis of the dimensional relationships between fundamental constants.

## Planck Units

The Planck length, time, and mass are defined as:

- Planck length: l_p = sqrt(hbar*G/c^3) ≈ 1.616 × 10^-35 m
- Planck time: t_p = sqrt(hbar*G/c^5) ≈ 5.391 × 10^-44 s
- Planck mass: m_p = sqrt(hbar*c/G) ≈ 2.176 × 10^-8 kg

## Dimensional Relationships

The relationship between these units forms the foundation of quantum gravity theories.
