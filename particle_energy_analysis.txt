Energy Potential Analysis for a Particle with Circumference = 1 Planck Length
================================================================================

Framework: G₄ = 1 (Planck units)

In this framework, we set the gravitational constant G₄ = 1, along with ħ = c = 1,
which defines the Planck units system. This allows us to express all physical
quantities in terms of the fundamental Planck scales.

Particle Properties:
  Circumference = 1 Planck length
  Radius = 0.15915494309189535 Planck length

Energy Components:
  1. Gravitational potential energy = -6.283185307179586
     This represents the self-gravitational energy of the particle.

  2. Quantum uncertainty energy = 6.283185307179586
     This arises from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, where
     confining a particle to a radius r induces an energy of order 1/r.

  3. π-derived boundary correction = 0.01000693763481415
     This term connects the transcendental nature of π to the boundary
     conditions of the particle. The 'extra digits' of π beyond 3.14
     (specifically, π - 3.14 = 0.00159...) create a small but significant
     correction to the energy, linking the geometric boundary to the
     energy states.

Total energy potential = 0.01000693763481415

Interpretation:
The energy potential of this imaginary particle demonstrates how the
transcendental nature of π can influence physical properties in a G₄=1
framework. The boundary conditions, determined by the circumference being
exactly 1 Planck length, create a unique energy profile where the 'extra digits'
of π contribute to the total energy.

This suggests a deep connection between the geometric properties of the
particle (its boundary defined by π) and its energy states. The least
possible energy use would occur at the radius where the derivative of the
energy function equals zero, representing an equilibrium configuration.

In this model, the particle's energy is minimized when the gravitational
attraction is balanced against the quantum uncertainty and the π-derived
boundary effects, creating a stable configuration that reflects the
fundamental constants of nature in the G₄=1 framework.
