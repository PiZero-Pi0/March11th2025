# The G4=1 Hypothesis

The G4=1 hypothesis proposes that the gravitational constant G has a natural value of 1 when expressed in appropriate units.

## Theoretical Implications

When G4=1, the equations of general relativity and quantum mechanics can be unified in a more elegant framework.

## Experimental Predictions

The G4=1 hypothesis predicts specific effects at the Planck scale that might be indirectly observable.
